# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple console-based word-guessing game where players can guess letters or full words to reveal the mystery word. 

## Features
- Single-player mode (random word chosen from a word list)
- Two-player mode (player 1 chooses a word for player 2 to guess)
- A limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends
- Word list management for dynamic gameplay

## How to Play
1. Start the game by running the program.
2. Choose between single-player mode or two-player mode.
3. Guess letters or entire words to reveal the mystery word.
4. You lose if you make 7 incorrect guesses!

## Requirements
- **Java**: The program is written in Java and requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run.

## Files Included
- `Hangman.java`: The main program file containing the Hangman game logic.
- `wordlist.txt`: A list of words used in single-player mode.

## How to Run the Game
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
